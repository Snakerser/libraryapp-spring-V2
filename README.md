# libraryapp-springV2
Updated library app

Now instead of JBDStemplate, Hibernate and Spring Data JPA are used to work with the database.

Added new features, such as:
- Pagination for books;
- Search books by name;
- Tracking the date a person's profile was added/edited.

Tested on Apache Tomcat 9.0.72.
